1. Bubble Sort:
   - Best-case time complexity: \(O(n)\) (when the array is already sorted)
   - Average-case time complexity: \(O(n^2)\)
   - Worst-case time complexity: \(O(n^2)\)

2. Insertion Sort:
   - Best-case time complexity: \(O(n)\) (when the array is nearly sorted)
   - Average-case time complexity: \(O(n^2)\)
   - Worst-case time complexity: \(O(n^2)\)

3. Merge Sort:
   - Time complexity: \(O(n \log n)\) in all cases (best-case, average-case, worst-case)

4. Selection Sort:
   - Best-case time complexity: \(O(n^2)\)
   - Average-case time complexity: \(O(n^2)\)
   - Worst-case time complexity: \(O(n^2)\)

5. Quick Sort:
   - Best-case time complexity: \(O(n \log n)\) (when the pivot divides the array into equal halves)
   - Average-case time complexity: \(O(n \log n)\)
   - Worst-case time complexity: \(O(n^2)\) (when the pivot consistently selects the smallest or largest element)
